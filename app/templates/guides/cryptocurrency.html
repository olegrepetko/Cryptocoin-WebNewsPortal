                 alt="cryptography world and cryptocurrencies" width="300" height="300"/><strong>A cryptocurrency
            is a medium of exchange like <em>normal</em> currencies such as USD, but designed for the purpose of
            exchanging digital information through a process made possible by certain principles of cryptography.
            Cryptography is used to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new <em>coins</em>. The first
            cryptocurrency to be created was <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> back in
            2009. Today there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, often referred to as <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/altcoin/">Altcoins</a>.</strong></p>

        <p><em><strong>Put another way, cryptocurrency is electricity converted into lines of code with monetary value.
            In the simplest of forms, cryptocurrency is digital currency.</strong></em></p>

        <p>Unlike centralized banking, like <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/" rel="follow">the Federal Reserve
            System</a>, where governments control the value of a currency like USD through the process of printing fiat
            money, government has no control over cryptocurrencies as they are <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">fully decentralized</a>.</p>

        <p>Most cryptocurrencies are designed to decrease in production over time like Bitcoin, which creates a market
            cap on them. That's different from fiat currencies where financial institutions can always create more,
            hence inflation. Bitcoin will never have more than 21 million coins in circulation. The technical system on
            which all cryptocurrencies are based on was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

        <p>While hundreds of different cryptocurrency specifications exist, most are derived from one of two protocols;
            <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoins-future-proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work/">Proof-of-work or
                Proof-of-stake</a>. All cryptocurrencies are maintained by a community of
            <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> <strong>miners</strong> who are members of the general public that have set
            up their computers or <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/asic-mining">ASIC machines</a> to
            participate in the validation and processing of transactions.</p>

        <h2>History of Cryptocurrency</h2>

        <h2><img class=" wp-image-43541 alignleft"
                 src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bitcoin-stack.jpg" alt="bitcoin stack"
                 width="300" height="300"/></h2>

        <p><strong>The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer named
            Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, which is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the <a
                    rel="follow href=">U.S National Security Agency</a>. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is based on
            the proof-of-work system.</strong></p>

        <p>In April 2011, <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/turkeys-twitter-ban-push-citizens-namecoin/">Namecoin</a>, the
            first <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/altcoin/">altcoin</a>, was created to form a decentralized
            DNS to make internet censorship more difficult. In October 2011, <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/litecoin-news/">Litecoin</a> was released and became
            the first successful cryptocurrency to use <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/zeusminer-global-scrypt-mining-network-next-gen-scrypt-miners/">scrypt</a>
            as its hash function rather than SHA-256. This gave the general public the ability to mine for litecoins
            without the purchase of specific hardware such as the <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/purchase-asic-scrypt-miner/">ASIC machines </a>used to mine
            Bitcoin.</p>

        <p><strong>Litecoin began receiving media attention in late 2013 - reaching a market cap of $1 billion. <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/ripple/">Ripplecoin</a>, created in 2011, was built on the
            same protocol as Bitcoin but services as a payment system - think of it like a Paypal for cryptocurrencies
            that supports any fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or even frequent flier miles.</strong></p>

        <h3>Cryptocurrencies &amp; Market Capitalization</h3>

        <p>Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in both market capitalization, volume, acceptance and notoriety, but
            it's not the most valuable coin. <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nemstake/">NEMstake</a>, while
            only having a market cap of $1,116,720, trades at $1,117 a coin. Looking at the market cap, <a
                    href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/">Litecoin</a> takes second place after Bitcoin
            with <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/">Ripple</a> close behind.</p>

        <p>One coin that you are more than likely familiar with is <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/dogecoin-news">Dogecoin</a>. Dogecoin ranks, on average,
            thirds in trading volume, but has a relatively low market cap - ranking number six in the largest
            cryptocurrency.</p>

                 src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hash.jpg" alt="hash" width="300"
                 height="250"/>What is a Cryptocurrency Hash?</h2>

        <p>Cryptocurrency mining power is rated on a scale of hashes per seconds. A rig with a computing power of 1kH/s
            is mining at a rate of 1,000 hashes a second, 1MH/s is a million hashes per second and a GH/s is one billion
            hashes per second. Every time a miner successfully solves a block, a new hash is created. A hash algorithm
            turns this large amount of data into a fixed-length hash. Like a code if you know the algorithm you can
            solve a hash and get the original data out, but to the ordinary eye it's just a bunch of numbers crammed
            together and remains practically impossible to get the original data out of.</p>

        <h2>SHA vs. Scrypt</h2>

        <p><strong>While Bitcoin and a several other coins are mined using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2"
                                                                              rel="follow">SHA-256</a>, Litecoin and
            many other coins, use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt" rel="follow">Scrypt</a>. This are the
            two major hashing functions, but several different kinds exists and are used by other cryptpcurrencies such
            as <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/scrypt-n/">scrypt-N</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/pros-cons-x11-algorithm/">x11</a>. The different hashing
            functions were adopted to answer concerns with the SHA-256. Before, individuals were able to mine Bitcoin
            with their GPU's, which require a large amount of energy. But as Bitcoin grew in popularity, ASIC SHA-256
            machine were built which made GPU mining obsolete.</strong></p>

        <p>To give you an idea of just how powerful these machines are, a mining rig running 4 GPU's would get a hash
            rate of around 3.4 MH/s and consume 3600kW/h while an ASIC machine can <a
                    href="https://www.mining-asics-technologies.com/product/titanium-asic-bitcoin-miner-universal-sha/">mine
                6 TH/s</a> and consume 2200kW/h. This effectively killed GPU mining and left many individuals worried
            about the security of the network. With less individuals being able to profitably mine from their home
            computer, the network become less decentralized. Scrypt mining was implemented with the promise of being
            ASIC resistant due to the memory problem it introduced.</p>

        <p>Scrypt hashes require lots of memory, which GPU's are already designed to handle and ASIC machines were not.
            However, Scrypt mining require a lot of energy and eventually <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/scrypt-asic-miner">scrypt-ASIC machines</a> were designed
            to address this problem. At this point Litecoin considered <a
                    href="https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=11864.0" rel="follow">changing their proof-of-work
                function</a> to avoid ASIC mining. Scrypt also taut that their proof-of-work is much more energy
            efficient than SHA-256. Bitcoin blocks are solved at a rate of 1 per 10 minutes while Litecoin blocks are
            solver at a rate of 1 per 2.5 minutes.</p>

        <h2><img class="alignleft  wp-image-43552"

                 width="300" height="300"/>Cryptocurrency Security</h2>

        <p>The security of cryptocurrencies is two part. The first part comes from the difficulty in finding hash set
            intersections, a task done by miners. The second and more likely of the two cases is a <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/4-lines-defence-51-attack/">"51%‚Äù attack</a>". In this
            scenario, a miner who has the mining power of more than 51% of the network, can take control of the global
            <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">blockchain</a> ledger and generate an alternative
            block-chain. Even at this point the attacker is limited to what he can do. The attacker could reverse his
            own transactions or block other transactions.</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrencies are also less susceptible to seizure by law enforcement or having transaction holds placed
            on them from acquirers such as <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/paypal-announces-bitcoin-integration-braintree/">Paypal</a>.
            All cryptocurrencies are pseudo-anonymous, and some coins have added features to create true anonymity.</p>

        <p>In the U.S., the IRS has ruled that Bitcoin is<a

            Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="http://www.fincen.gov/" rel="follow">FinCEN</a>) has issued guidelines
            for cryptocurrencies. The issued guidelines contain an important caveat for Bitcoin miners: it warns that
            anyone creating bitcoins and exchanging them for fiat currency are not necessarily beyond the reach of the
            law. It states:</p>
        <blockquote><p>‚ÄúA person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another
            person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money
            transmitter.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
        <p><strong>Miners seem to fall into this category, which could theoretically make them liable for MTB
            classification. This is a bone of contention for bitcoin miners, who have asked for clarification. This
            issue has not been publicly addressed in a court of law to date.</strong></p>
