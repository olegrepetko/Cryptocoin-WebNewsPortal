                alt="bitcoin money exchange" width="501" height="344"/>At first, buying or selling bitcoin online
            appear a daunting task. But it's not. Often, it's just like using PayPal or any other online payment system.
            Skip over to a bitcoin exchange and have a merry time lining your pockets with your currency of
            choice.</strong></p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/bitcoin-exchanges">Bitcoin exchanges</a> are hubs where you
            can exchange money for <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, or vice versa. This
            article will provide an overview exchange landscape and dissect the thick variety of online options.</p>

        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Trusting your money to an exchange can be dangerous. Imprudent exchanges have lost
            customer bitcoins in the past. Be careful. Proceed only if you understand that this can occur.</p>

        <h2>Using a Bitcoin Exchange</h2>

        <p>Exchanges connect bitcoin buyers to sellers, offering an easy way for users to buy or sell bitcoin without
            meeting with another person that wants to trade the exact amount of bitcoin. The definition of an exchange
            is a little murky. For example, with some services, buying and selling bitcoins is the sole goal. Other
            services are integrated platforms, paired with <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/bitcoin-wallet/">bitcoin wallets</a> and other features
            that the users can use. For the purposes of this guide, exchanges are defined as any service that allows
            buying and selling bitcoin on its payment service, whether its the only service it provides or not.</p>

        <p>Before going further, you need to set up a wallet, so you have some place to put your bitcoins.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/start-using-bitcoin/"><em>Not sure how to set up a wallet? Check out
            the “How to start using Bitcoin?” guide here.</em></a></p>

        <p>Navigating online exchanges is usually pretty easy. For most exchanges, you will need to hook up with a bank
            account, which can take a couple days (<a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/coinbase">Coinbase</a>
            offers instant verification if you login with your bank username). Generally, the sites, like <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/bitstamp">Bitstamp</a> shown below, will display “buy” or
            “sell” links. Type in the amount of bitcoins you want to buy or sell. Click a button that indicates
            willingness to complete the transaction. Then you're good to go.</p>

                alt="how to buy and sell bitcoins" width="579" height="521"/></p>

        <p>The drawback of these virtual exchanges is that depositing and withdrawing bitcoins in fiat (USD, Euro, or
            similar) is a slow process. Usually it takes 2-5 days before you receive any withdrawal back on your bank
            account, same when you send funds to deposit on a Bitcoin exchange. <strong>Trading them in-person is
                instant (check out <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/" rel="follow">LocalBitcoins.com</a>). </strong>But
            the convenience of buying and selling online without the hassle of setting up a meeting with another person
            is one reason online <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/bitcoin-exchanges">exchanges</a> like
            Bitstamp and Coinbase are so popular.</p>

        <p><strong>Exchanges generally charge a trading fee under 1%.</strong></p>

        <h2>Know Your Customer laws and Other Bitcoin Regulations</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin exchanges must conform to state <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/bitcoin-regulation/">regulations</a>. In order to comply
            with these regulations, customers are prompted to verify their identity in order to participate. Regulations
            vary between country, but exchanges generally must abide by Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money
            Laundering (AML) laws.</p>

        <p>Because of this, exchanges often don't provide as much privacy or anonymity as many Bitcoin enthusiasts
            like.</p>

        <h2>The Present State of Bitcoin Exchanges</h2>

        <p><strong>Bitcoin exchanges aren't exactly short in supply. More are always popping up to enter the fray or
            improve on different aspects of the exchange status quo. Established quality exchanges that have built up
            trust are smaller in number.</strong></p>

        <p>Described within are a few long-established, trusted places to buy and sell bitcoins in USD. <a
                href="https://coinbase.com/" rel="follow">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/"
                                                                           rel="follow">Bitstamp</a>, and <a
                href="https://btc-e.com/" rel="follow">BTC-e</a>, have established themselves as the dominant exchanges.
            Coinbase is probably the most trusted, while BTC-e is more mysterious. The owners have yet to reveal their
            identities, no one is sure where it is located, and the website features scrolls of Cyrillic text. A more
            comprehensive list of exchanges can be found <a
                    href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins#Direct_.2F_Bulk_Buying" rel="follow">here</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Exchanges in non-U.S. countries are also numerous. But the availability of exchanges depends on the
            country and desired currency. Most exchanges don't support more than a couple currencies. Again, take a look
            at <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins#Direct_.2F_Bulk_Buying" rel="follow">this list</a>
            for a comprehensive view – it shows what currencies each exchange supports.</strong></p>

        <p>Both China and Russia have taken a harsh stance against the currency in the past. With uncertain regulations,
            it is a little trickier to gauge whether or not it is a safe idea to use companies based in regions that are
            less friendly to bitcoin.</p>

        <h2><img class="alignleft  wp-image-43283"
                 src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bitcoin-security.jpg"
                 alt="bitcoin security" width="388" height="291"/>Move towards higher security</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/mt-gox/">Mt. Gox</a>, the once-dominant bitcoin exchange,
            floundered and drowned earlier in 2014. After an alleged hacking, the former-king exchange lost many
            bitcoins. This is one reason some people may prefer to buy and sell Bitcoin in-person and use
            over-the-counter exchanges like <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/" rel="follow">LocalBitcoins</a>.</p>

        <p>That said, post-Mt. Gox many exchanges have made an extra effort to offer transparency and prove security of
            bitcoin. Third-party audits have been in vogue. Bitcoin exchanges are now expected to provide more evidence
            that they're taking careful care of the bitcoin their customers are trusting to them.</p>

        <p>Exchanges like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/audit-shows-kraken-reserve-covers-all-balances/">Kraken</a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/bitfinex-passes-stefan-thomass-proof-solvency-audit/2014/04/07">Bitfinex</a>
            quickly passed proof-of-solvency test post-Gox, which is a demonstration that the exchanges hold all the
            funds they claim to have. Bitstamp passed a test <span lang="zxx"><a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/bitstamp-provides-proof-bitcoin-solvency-first-step-towards-real-financial-audit/2014/05/27">conducted
                by core Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn</a></span>.</p>

        <p>It's a first step. In a sense, the exchanges are regulating themselves to gain the trust of customers. But
            these don't amount to a comprehensive financial audit, which should take weeks.</p>

        <h2>Future Bitcoin Exchanges and “Payment Platforms” to Look for</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.circle.com/" rel="follow">Circle</a> recently sprang up nailed to a mission to <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/circle-reveals-first-worldwide-bitcoin-bank-offers-10-bitcoin-new-customers/">bring
            bitcoin to the masses</a>. It aims to provide an easy-to-use product that isn't plagued by volatility,
            offers insurance, and is free to use. Pitched as a pseudo-bank for Bitcoin, it allows people to store and
            exchange bitcoin. It is currently invitation-only but will expand its audience.</p>

        <p><a href="https://bitreserve.org/" rel="follow">BitReserve</a>, creation of founder of CNET Halsey Minor, has
            another goal in mind: To stomp out Bitcoin volatility. That's a tall order. Currently, it's in beta. But
            once it opens up, it will allow conversion to and from five currencies – U.S. dollars, euros, pounds, yen
            and yuan.</p>

        <p>Also worth mentioning is a meager – but compelling – trend towards decentralized exchanges. <a
                href="http://www.coinffeine.com/" rel="follow">Coinffeine</a> <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/coinffeine-p2p-alternative-centralised-bitcoin-exchanges/">aims to
            develop a peer-to-peer platforming exchange</a>, requiring little to no trust in a centralized exchange.
            This tool would also give customers a lot more control over their bitcoin—although it can be riskier in
            other ways. User-friendly? For better or worse, at least developers want to make it an option for consumers.
