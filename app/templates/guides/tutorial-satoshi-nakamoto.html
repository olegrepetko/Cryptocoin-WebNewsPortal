            <p><em>Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of Bitcoin, still remains a myth to everyone. Will we
                ever know his true identity?</em></p></div>
        <p><strong>More than often, people who are newly introduced to <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>
            have no idea that the currency is already several years old. The idea of Bitcoin was first introduced in
            2008,
            when a man named '<a title="Satoshi Institute reveals Satoshi’s Bitcoin history"
                                 href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/satoshi-institute-reveals-satoshi-bitcoin-history/">Satoshi
                Nakamoto</a>' published a <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bitcoin/" target="_blank">paper</a> on
            The
            Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd.com. This paper was called Bitcoin: a peer to peer electronic cash
            system
            and is still a classic among the 'old school' Bitcoin fans. Not that much later, in 2009, he released the
            first
            Bitcoin software that enabled the world to start using Bitcoin.</strong></p>

        <h2>Satoshi Who?</h2>

        <p>So who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This is a question that still raises eyebrows all over the cryptocurrency world.
            There are plenty of suggested identities, which we will tackle later in this guide. Let's take a look first
            at
            what we know about Nakamoto. The first certainty we have is that he did not work alone. He held close
            contact
            with other developers through <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/" target="_blank">forums and
                e-mails</a>. He kept improving the source-code whilst taking advice from several other people. This
            continued until contacts between him and his team gradually began to fade. In the year 2010, he handed over
            control of the source code repository and alert key functions of the software to <a
                    title="Gavin Andresen Outlines Bitcoin 2.0 Without Ethereum"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/gavin-andresen-outlines-bitcoin-2-0-without-ethereum/">Gavin
                Andresen</a>, another prominent figure in the Bitcoin universe. With the source code, he also gave away
            the
            <a href="http://bitcoin.org" target="_blank">Bitcoin.org</a> domain and several other domains. After doing
            this,
            Nakamoto began to communicate less until he completely disappeared.</p>

        <p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-43563"
                src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/japan-bitcoin-price-1024x1024.jpg"
                alt="japan bitcoin price" width="300" height="300"/>Nakamoto himself claims to be a 37-year old male
            who
            lives in Japan. A false statement according to many people. His use of the English language is near perfect,
            and
            the Bitcoin software was never documented in Japanese. A strange behavior for someone who claims to have
            lived
            in Japan for his entire life.</p>

        <h2>Supposed Identities</h2>

        <p>By now, you must have come to the conclusion that there is a lot of mystery surrounding Bitcoin's inventor.
            If
            there is one thing the Internet likes, it's mystery (or rather solving it). This led Stefan Thomas, a Swiss
            coder and active community member, to a great idea. He decided to look into <a
                    href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/" target="_blank">the timestamps of Nakamoto's
                forum
                posts</a>. With over 500 posts, it had to be possible to find a pattern in it. His investigation
            resulted in
            a chart that showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 am, and 11 am GMT. It is very
            probable that Nakamoto was asleep at this time. When looking at the different time zones in the world,
            Nakamoto
            probably lives in the parts of North America that fall within the Eastern Time Zone and Central Time Zone.
            Parts
            of Central America, the Caribbean and South America are possibilities as well.</p>

        <p>It's great to know where Nakamoto probably lives, but it still brings us nowhere closer to his real identity.
            Are
            we even talking about a single person? Some people consider him to be a team of people. A lot of prominent
            coders think the Bitcoin code was too well designed for one person. Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who
            read
            the code, said that Nakamoto could either be a "team of people" or a "pure genius".</p>

        <p>That said, many identities have been pinned on the Bitcoin developer over the years.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 2011 article in The New Yorker written by Joshua Davis suggested that Nakamoto's identity was pinned
                down
                to a number of possible individuals. The most notable among them were Finnish economic sociologist Dr.
                Vili
                Lehdonvirta and Irish student Michael Clear. Both Lehdonvirta and Clear responded by strongly denying
                this.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In October 2011, Adam Penenberg claimed he found evidence suggesting Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and
                Charles
                Bry could be Nakamoto. As an investigative journalist writing for Fast Company, he found they jointly
                filed
                a patent application that contained the phrase "computationally impractical to reverse". This was also
                used
                in the Bitcoin white paper. To add even more proof, he showed that the domain name bitcoin.org was
                registered three days after the patent was filed. All of them denied being Nakamoto.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In May 2013, Ted Nelson speculated that Shinichi Mochizuki was Satoshi Nakamoto. Mochizuki was a
                Japanese
                mathematician. These speculations were denied in an article in The Age Newspaper, without attributing a
                source for the denial.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Also in 2013, Nakamoto was linked to <a title="IRS ruling to help Silk Road creator in court"
                                                        href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/irs-ruling-to-help-silk-road-creator-in-court/">Ross
                William Ulbricht</a>, owner of the Silk Road. This link was published in a paper written by two Israeli
                mathematicians, Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir. They based this on an analysis of the Blockchain. They later
                retracted their claim.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In April 2014, investigators from Aston University linked <a
                    title="UK University claims law professor Nick Szabo authored Bitcoin whitepaper"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/university-claims-law-professor-nick-szabo-created-bitcoin/">Nick
                Szabo</a> to the Bitcoin whitepaper using a stylometric analysis. Szabo is a decentralized currency
                enthusiast and published a paper on "bitgold," which is considered a precursor to bitcoin. The claim was
                not
                really taken serious when even the investigators claimed that it was a far-fetched theory: "The study
                does
                not point conclusively to Mr. Szabo. It's just that, of all the people studied, he appears to be the
                most
                likely candidate. It's just another clue."
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>But the most well-known speculation to date came in March 2014. An article in the magazine Newsweek, written
            by
            journalist Leah McGrath Goodman, identified <a title="Bitcoin Community Doubts Satoshi Nakamoto Identity"
                                                           href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-community-doubts-satoshi-nakamoto-identity/">Dorian
                Satoshi Nakamoto</a>. As a Japanese American living in California, he fits the bill for Newsweek.
            Unfortunately, Dorian Nakamoto immediately <a
                    title="Dorian Nakamoto Issues Final Public Statement, Lawyers Up"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dorian-nakamoto-statement/">responded
                by denying</a> everything. "I did not create, invent or otherwise work on Bitcoin. I unconditionally
            deny
            the Newsweek report." He even <a title="Dorian Nakamoto Issues Final Public Statement, Lawyers Up"
                                             href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dorian-nakamoto-statement/">filed a
                lawsuit</a> against Newsweek as he had journalists camping out in front of his house and chasing him by
            car
            whenever he left. The Bitcoin community, led by Andreas Antonopoulos started <a
                    title="Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto thanks Bitcoin Community in Video"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dorian-nakamoto-thanks-bitcoin-community/">a fundraising
                campaign</a> to support Dorian Nakamoto.</p>

        <p>The Newsweek report led to a worldwide interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity. Maybe the greatest thing
            about
            this was that it made the real Nakamoto break his long silence. At the p2pfoundation website, Satoshi
            Nakamoto
            <a title="Breaking – “Satoshi Nakomoto” Breaks Long Silence To Deny Being Dorian Nakomoto"
               href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/breaking-satoshi-nakomoto-breaks-long-silence-deny-dorian-nakomoto/">replied</a>
            to his latest thread with the following words: "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."</p>

        <p>So if there is one thing we can be sure of, it's the fact that we have no clue whatsoever as to who Satoshi
            Nakamoto really is. Is he a genius who is singlehandedly responsible for developing a revolutionary
            protocol? Or
            is Satoshi Nakamoto a pseudonym for a team of people? Nakamoto is believed to be in possession of roughly
            one
            million bitcoins. His identity remains one of the web's most questioned mysteries.</p>
