                        width="507" height="354"/>Bitcoin's value is a perceived regard for its benefits and usefulness.
            The
            term <em>value,</em> as used here, is not to be confused with <em><a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price/">price</a>, </em>which is the monetary cost of
            a <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>. The usefulness and consequent value of
            Bitcoin is a result of many aspects of its innovation, its network, and its features. This guide discusses
            the most important factors that lead its users to consider Bitcoin to be valuable.</strong></p>

        <h2>Scientific Value</h2>

        <p>To the general field of Science, the Bitcoin innovation is valuable for having solved the long-standing <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem" target="_blank" rel="follow">Two Generals
            Problem</a> (or Byzantine Generals’ Problem). <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tutorial-satoshi-nakamoto/" target="_blank">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>’s
            clever solution to the dilemma of digital <em>double-spending</em> is achieved via a self-organizing and
            time-based consensus record. The <strong>blockchain</strong>, a <em>shared public ledger</em>, is maintained
            by the peer-to-peer nodes that populate the Bitcoin network.</p>

        <h2>Technological Value</h2>

        <p>Because Bitcoin is decentralized via a distributed peer-to-peer network, there is no central server that the
            Bitcoin protocol depends upon for its existence. Like BitTorrent, Bitcoin is, therefore, <strong>censorship-resistant</strong>
            - it cannot be shut down. This aspect of Bitcoin is critical since it means that Bitcoin's continued usage
            is not subject to any external authority's approval, opinion or action. Being a censorship-resistant
            alternative to official currency and payment systems makes Bitcoin an irreversible disruptive technology.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Value</h2>

        <p>Satoshi Nakamoto's innovations in the field of Computer Science are significant milestones. In addition, a
            social implication of the way Bitcoin innovates payment and transactions is that it <em>eliminates
                Trust</em>. A distributed ledger and decentralized network means that no single entity needs to be
            trusted in order for the Bitcoin protocol to function. Each Bitcoin user owns and controls their own money
            outright, and is solely responsible for its security and usage. No third party, such as a bank or
            centralized issuer, needs to be implicitly trusted to hold, disburse or maintain one's bitcoin holdings.
            This <strong>trust-less</strong> dimension of Bitcoin eliminates the risks associated with having to trust
            external authorities - in fact, the network effect of Bitcoin's decentralization will be to, over time, <em>eliminate
                centralized authorities everywhere</em>.</p>

        <h2>Token of Value</h2>

        <p>Although a bitcoin can be copied many times, it can only ever be spent once. This design feature can be
            verified by making a copy of an existing Bitcoin wallet to another computer. The same bitcoins will exist in
            two physical locations, but only the first spend transaction will succeed. The network will recognize a
            second attempt to spend the same bitcoins as a double-spend and reject it. This is the critical innovation
            that sets Bitcoin apart from all previous attempts at creating digital <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">currency</a>.</p>

        <h2><img class="alignleft  wp-image-44600"

                 width="288"
                 height="288"/>Bitcoin's Design Value</h2>

        <p>With the solution to double-spending as its foundation, Bitcoin's explicit design features offer users
            additional value:</p>

        <p>1. Payment method (currency)<br/>
            2. Storage of Wealth (secure storage and transmission)<br/>
            3. Decentralized Public Transaction ledger (blockchain)<br/>
            4. Contract Mechanism (mostly unused despite its vast potential)</p>

        <p>In day-to-day usage, the first three applications of Bitcoin are pervasive and often overlap.</p>

        <h2>Secured Value</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin uses <em>public-private key pairs</em> to secure transactions. A Bitcoin address is a public key
            generated from a private key held in a user's <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/start-using-bitcoin/"
                                                             target="_blank">wallet</a>. A Bitcoin transaction destined
            for an address generated by a wallet is signed with that address's public key, and can only be "unlocked"
            (or spent) with the matching private key. Hence, Bitcoin transactions are secured against theft. The
            underlying mechanism that prevents double-spending secures Bitcoin against forgery.</p>

                alt="Open Source Bitcoin" width="300" height="225"/></p>

        <h2>Value in Development</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin is made available as <em>Free and Open Source Software</em> under the MIT license. Additionally, the
            protocol is also developed via the Open Source project model which encourages community contribution and
            <em>collaboration</em>.</p>

        <p>Collaborative development of publicly available source code is considered to be preferable to closed source
            code developed by a contained team. Bugs and security fixes are identified and fixed quickly - and around
            the clock - while the principle of strength in numbers and diversity of skills allows greater
            productivity.</p>

        <p>The <em>Bitcoin Core Developers</em> are mostly unpaid volunteers who maintain and manage the Bitcoin source
            code. If their work was any less critical and exciting, one could describe it as a "thankless task", yet
            they represent some of the hardest working developers in the field. The <em>coredevs</em> contribute
            thousands of hours of code writing and rigorous adherence to Satoshi's design specifications in order to
            translate the Bitcoin vision into reality.</p>

        <h2>Network Value</h2>

        <p><img class="alignright  wp-image-44591"
                src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bitcoin-network.jpg"
                alt="bitcoin network" width="423" height="338"/>The Bitcoin network is a <strong>decentralized
            peer-to-peer network</strong> that, ideally, is both <em>distributed</em> and <em>diverse</em>. The more
            widely the peer-to-peer nodes are distributed, the more decentralized the network. The more diverse
            (non-similar) the nodes are, the broader the representation on the network and, hence, it is more resilient
            and secure. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to seek consensus amongst nodes, and greater decentralization
            means a healthier, more robust network. All of these factors contribute to a more valuable
            <em>blockchain</em>.</p>

        <h2>Miners Are Valuable</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin Miners are rewarded bitcoins for processing transactions into blocks. Mined blocks are typically
            appended to the blockchain, and become part of the public ledger. By processing transactions, building the
            <em>blockchain</em>, and hosting the peer-to-peer nodes that <strong>maintain network consensus</strong>,
            miners represent the backbone of Bitcoin's distributed network. For their task of keeping the network
            functional at all times and maintaining the precious <em>blockchain</em>, miners (in a close tie with the
            developers) are the Bitcoin<br/>
            protocol users who add the most value.</p>

        <h2><img class="alignleft  wp-image-44595"
                 src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/value.jpg" alt="value" width="289"
                 height="301"/>Value Transmission and Storage</h2>

        <p>The world's reserve currency, along with most other national currencies, can be exchanged for bitcoins and
            <em>stored</em> or <em>transmitted</em> via the Bitcoin network. It seems to that, as the amount of money
            increases, so the benefits of using Bitcoin storage/transmission also increase.</p>

        <p>Bitcoins in storage can be secured by different means, including passwords, biometric readers and multiple
            signature transactions. Although theft of, say, a password or human error can still result in loss of stored
            bitcoins, the risks are far less than in the case of physical assets such as paper money or gold bullion.
            Transmitting bitcoins via the payment network is cheaper and faster than transferring an equivalent amount
            via traditional channels, and less cumbersome and more secure than transporting an equivalent amount of
            bullion.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Contract and Application Value</h2>

        <p><img class="alignright  wp-image-44592"
                src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bitcoin-values-1024x1024.jpg"
                alt="bitcoin values" width="434" height="434"/>Bitcoin <strong>Contracts</strong> are described by
            Satoshi Nakamoto, although this aspect of the protocol has found few applications to date. Contracts extend
            the multi-signature facility of Bitcoin by allowing two or more parties to engage in agreements that are
            fulfilled by events that are <em>external</em> to the Bitcoin network. Examples include Options Contracts,
            Wills and even simple binary bets such as the outcome of the Brazilian Women's Volleyball match. In the
            future, this facility of Bitcoin will be better understood, used more frequently and add more value to the
            protocol.</p>

        <p>The distributed <em>blockchain</em> is designed to accommodate <em>alternate chains</em>, thereby opening the
            door to applications that both use and enhance the Bitcoin protocol. These <strong>distributed
                applications</strong> will add value by making Bitcoin more useful.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>We've seen how Bitcoin's value cannot be reduced to one single element or feature. Many aspects of the
            cryptocurrency contribute to its usefulness and offer benefits that outweigh traditional paper money and its
            encumbent systems. As a decentralized network with a consensus-based ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain has
            features that are innovative and encourage further innovation. Bitcoin's Open Source Software model
            facilitates additions and improvements.</p>

        <p>The value of Bitcoin's core function of being a payment, storage and accounting network is evident from the
            fact that <em>users are willing to purchase bitcoins</em>, <em>transact in bitcoins</em> and <em>use its
                networked ledger</em>. At the time of writing an average of <a
                    href="https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions" target="_blank">62,000 Bitcoin transactions</a>
            are conducted daily with an average volume of <a
                    href="https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?daysAverageString=7"
                    target="_blank">$50mil per day</a>.</p>
