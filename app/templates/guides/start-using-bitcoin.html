            href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">what Bitcoin is</a> and how it works. So now, why
        not
        actually start using bitcoins? It's incredibly easy to send and receive BTC, and this guide will show
        you
        how to get setup as a regular Bitcoin user or a Bitcoin merchant. Let's get started.</strong>


        <h2>Your Bitcoin Wallet</h2>

        <p>As with all forms of currency, you need a place to keep your money. With traditional (fiat) currency,
            most people keep a small amount of money in a wallet or purse while keeping the rest of their savings at
            the bank. Let's see how to do something similar with bitcoins. While there are many different ways to
            store bitcoins, this guide will examine some of the easiest methods for new users.</p>

        <p>In simplest terms, bitcoins are stored in <strong>digital wallets</strong>. A <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/bitcoin-wallet">Bitcoin wallet</a> is simply a piece of
            software that can store, send, and receive BTC. However, there are many different wallets to choose
            from, each with its&nbsp;own pros and cons. Regardless of what you choose, it's a good idea to keep two
            wallets - one for spending and one for your savings. Bitcoin doesn't rely on financial institutions like
            banks, and instead, users have complete control over their money. While this might sound like a huge
            responsibility, this guide aims to show how easy it is to be your own bank.</p>

        <h3>Your Spending (Hot) Bitcoin Wallet</h3>

        <p>Your first wallet will be used for day to day transactions, similar to the physical wallet in your pocket
            or purse. This type of wallet is also sometimes referred to as a "hot wallet," meaning that it is
            connected to the Internet. One very popular and easy to use hot wallet is <a title="Blockchain Wallet"
                                                                                         href="https://blockchain.info/wallet"
                                                                                         rel="follow">Blockchain.info</a>,
            a wallet that can conveniently be accessed from anywhere in the world on any device as long as you're
            connected to the Internet. To start using Blockchain, simply navigate to <a title="Create a New Wallet"
                                                                                        href="https://blockchain.info/wallet/new">this
                page</a>, and create an account. In just a few simple steps, you'll have your own Bitcoin wallet!
        </p>

             src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-08-at-12.31.30-pm.png"
             alt="Blockchain Wallet">

        <p class="wp-caption-text">After logging in to your newly created wallet, you should see something like
            this, minus the $31k.</p>

        <p><strong>Notice the QR code on the left and the text next to it. This is your Bitcoin address. If anyone
            wants to send you money, they send it to your unique address. If you want to send someone money, you go
            to the "Send Money" tab and enter that person's address and the amount of bitcoins you want to send.
            It's that easy.</strong></p>

        <img class="size-full"
             src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-08-at-12.38.57-pm.png"
             alt="Send Bitcoins">

        <p class="wp-caption-text">Sending money has never been simpler. You can send bitcoins to anyone
            anywhere in the world without expensive fees.</p>

        <p><strong>You may have noticed something interesting. You are encouraged to share your Bitcoin address. A
            Bitcoin address doesn't need to be kept private and protected the way a credit card number does.
            Instead, a Bitcoin address functions much like a mailing address. Anyone can send you mail, but only you
            have the key to access the mail in your mailbox. Similarly, anyone can send bitcoins to your address,
            but only you have access to the coins you receive. </strong></p>

        <p>Compare this to a credit card number or a debit card number.If you want to make a transaction, you have
            to give the merchant total access to your funds, and trust that he/she will only withdraw the amount
            authorized. But with <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, you send the money
            rather than having the merchant take the money from your wallet. As you will see, Bitcoin eliminates the
            need to trust third parties (although in some instances it can be convenient to trust one), and is in
            many ways a lot safer than traditional money.</p>

        <p>Speaking of third parties, is Blockchain safe? The short answer is, yes. Blockchain's <a
                title="Blockchain Source Code" href="https://github.com/blockchain" rel="follow">source code</a> is
            available for anyone to examine, meaning that users can be sure that the service isn't doing anything
            suspicious behind the scenes. Furthermore, Blockchain does not have access to users' private keys and is
            considered sufficiently secure by most in the Bitcoin community. Of course, for the truly paranoid, you
            could download a <a title="Desktop Wallets" href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet"
                                rel="follow">desktop wallet client</a> such as Bitcoin Core or Electrum. Since the
            software would be on your own computer rather than Blockchain's servers, it could be considered more
            secure. However, the downside would be&nbsp;that your wallet would only be accessible from your
            computer. Services like Blockchain provide both convenience and reasonably good security, which is
            important for an everyday wallet.</p>

        <h3>Your Savings (Cold) Bitcoin Wallet</h3>

        <p><strong>Now this is where you want to make as few compromises as possible regarding security. Your
            savings wallet will be similar to your savings account at the bank. Since you'll be keeping most of your
            bitcoins here, you'll want to use the best possible security. One of the ways to achieve this is by
            making your savings wallet a "cold wallet," meaning that it's not connected to the Internet. By
            remaining offline, a cold wallet is far less vulnerable to hackers. A very easy to use cold storage
            solution is <a title="Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Vault is Now Available to All"
                           href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-vault-now-available/">Coinbase
                Vault</a>.</strong></p>

        <img class="size-full"
             src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-24-at-12.23.43-pm.png"
             alt="Coinbase Vault is Now Available to All">

        <p class="wp-caption-text">Coinbase's Vault offers easy to use long-term storage for bitcoins.</p>

        <p>Without getting into the technical details, the way the Vault works is that Coinbase stores your bitcoins
            offline in various secure locations around the globe.&nbsp;Withdrawing coins from the Vault requires
            multiple layers of verification, and withdrawals are time-delayed by 48 hours, meaning the transaction
            can be cancelled during that 48-hour window. Coinbase has been independently audited by trusted members
            of the community, and is used by prominent companies such as <a
                    title="Why Dell Just Became The Largest Ecommerce Business To Accept Bitcoin"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dell-just-became-largest-ecommerce-business-accept-bitcoin/">Dell</a>,
            <a title="Expedia Experiments With Bitcoin"
               href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/expedia-experiments-bitcoin/">Expedia</a>, and <a
                    title="DISH to Become Largest Company to Accept Bitcoin"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/dish-to-become-largest-company-to-accept-bitcoin/">DISH
                Network</a>.</p>

        <p>But of course, as mentioned above, you don't&nbsp;<em>need</em> to trust a third party like Coinbase. It
            just might be more convenient, especially for newer users. To&nbsp;<em>truly</em> be your own bank, you
            can generate a <a title="Bitcoin Paper Wallet" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Paper_wallet"
                              rel="follow">paper wallet </a>or use an offline <a title="Hardware Wallet"
                                                                                 href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_wallet"
                                                                                 rel="follow">hardware wallet</a>.
            But these are beyond the scope of this guide.</p>

        <h2>Using Your Bitcoins</h2>

        <p>So you've got your wallets set up. Now it's time to start using those bitcoins! If you don't have any
            BTC, you can&nbsp;buy some from a <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchanges/">Bitcoin
                exchange</a>. There are also some <strong>free ways to get bitcoins</strong>. But of course, the
            most basic feature of money is that it can be used to buy things. So where can you actually spend
            bitcoins?&nbsp;The list might surprise you:</p>

        <p>Furthermore, services like Gyft allow users to purchase gift cards for various stores with Bitcoin. This
            essentially allows users to use bitcoins at Amazon, Target, and other retailers that don't yet accept
            Bitcoin payments. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, undoubtedly more and more companies will start
            accepting Bitcoin payments as Bitcoin provides a secure and easy way to transmit money online.</p>

        <h2>How to Accept Bitcoins For Merchants?</h2>

        <p><strong>Perhaps you've got your own business and are interested in accepting Bitcoin payments? If that's
            the case, services like <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/coinbase">Coinbase</a> and <a
                    title="Bitcoin Payment Processor Bitpay Goes Free and Unlimited Forever"

            it incredibly easy for merchants to accept bitcoins. Depending on how popular your business is, you'll
            see little to no fees for accepting bitcoins (and the fees will always be less than those of fiat
            payment processors like PayPal).</strong></p>

        <p>All in all, it's both easy and advantageous to start using Bitcoin. Hopefully this guide will help you
            get set up. And if you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>
