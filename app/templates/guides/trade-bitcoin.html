            do all the work for you, it’s important to understand how Bitcoin trading actually works before you dive
            into the deep end.</p>


        <h2>Choosing a Bitcoin Exchange</h2>

        <p>The first thing you need to do when you want to learn how to trade bitcoins is figure out where you’re going
            to be doing your trading. Although this is supposed to be a decentralized, P2P currency, the reality is that
            it’s currently impossible to do high-frequency trading without the help of a centralized server. These
            centralized servers have been known as a <a title="Report Suggests MtGox Fraud Led to $1200 Bitcoin Price"
                                                        href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/report-mtgox-fraud-led-to-1200-bitcoin-price/">point
                of weakness</a> for the Bitcoin market as a whole, but <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/coinbase-insurance-has-been-active-almost-year/"
                    target="_blank">improvements in security</a> have slowly been rolled out to various exchanges over
            time.</p>

        <p>If you’re going to trade bitcoins on a regular basis, then you’ll need to have some deposits at one or two <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchanges/" target="_blank">Bitcoin exchanges</a> at all
            times. While platform features and unique trading options may be the most important aspects of exchanges in
            other markets, the reality is that <a title="Breaking: CoinEx.pw hacked, all coins stolen"
                                                  href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/coinex-pw-hacked-all-coins-stolen/">security</a>
            is the most important feature to think about when trading bitcoins in a hot wallet. Factors such as
            longevity, two-factor authentication, and <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/huobi-implement-proof-reserves-program-pave-way-exchange-accountability/"
                    target="_blank">proof-of-reserve</a> are going to be the most important features to look at when
            choosing an exchange.</p>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Longevity and two-factor authentication are two factors that you probably have in the back of your head for
            traditional exchanges, but proof-of-reserve is a new feature for Bitcoin exchanges that should be viewed
            with the utmost importance. Bitcoin exchanges are able to prove that they actually have the bitcoins they
            say they have by signing messages from Bitcoin addresses containing large amounts of bitcoins, so this
            should calm some of your fears when it comes to the possibility of an exchange running a <a

                scheme</a>. Certain exchanges that offer proof-of-reserve, such as <a href="https://www.kraken.com/"
                                                                                      target="_blank" rel="follow">Kraken</a>
            and <a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/" target="_blank" rel="follow">Bitstamp</a>, should be at the top of
            your list.</p>

        <h2>Buy and Hold Bitcoins?</h2>

        <p><strong><img
                class="alignleft"

                width="300"
                height="250"/>Once you’ve signed up for a Bitcoin exchange and verified your account, you can
            then
            start to think about your own trading strategy. There are plenty of traders who try to time the market on a
            daily basis, but the reality is that the buy and hold strategy is the one that has paid off for the largest
            number of Bitcoin holders in the past. You never know when a piece of <a
                    title="Bobby Lee on Bitcoin in China: Business as usual"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bobby-lee-bitcoin-china-business-usual/">regulatory news out
                of China</a> or a newly announced killer app could cause a huge price swing one way or the other, so
            it’s usually a good idea to throw your emotions out the window and simply purchase bitcoins on a regular
            basis. This will be weekly for some traders, while others will decide to pick up a few bitcoins on the first
            of every month.</strong></p>

        <p>Attempting to trade bitcoins without understanding why you purchased them in the first place can also be a
            huge issue. Bitcoin has been known to drop in price by as much as 50% in a single day, so you cannot be
            tempted to exit the market at a loss when these kinds of events take place. Trading bitcoins without a view
            that the price will eventually go higher as the price increases can be problematic due to the fact that you
            will probably end up buying high and selling low.</p>

        <h2>Report Your Profits</h2>

        <p>One last thing to remember when it comes to trading bitcoins is that this currency is not really anonymous
            when you’re using a centralized exchange. After all, the exchange knows all about your true identity due to
            the various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer" target="_blank">AML and KYC
                regulations</a> they are all required to follow. Having your bitcoins increase in value in terms of
            dollars is not something that will be easy to hide from your local government during tax season. These
            earnings are viewed as capital gains in most countries, so you should remember to fill out your yearly tax
            return with that fact in mind.</p>
