            <p class="wp-caption-text">What is Bitcoin?</p></div>
        <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is a virtual or digital currency also known as a cryptocurrency created by the
            mysterious (and unknown) <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tutorial-satoshi-nakamoto/">Satoshi
                Nakamoto</a>. Bitcoin is like other currencies: it can be used to purchase items locally and
            electronically. However, bitcoin differs from conventional money in that it is decentralized and fully
            independent. No institution controls the Bitcoin Network and it is not tied to a country like the US Dollar.
            The entire network is maintained by individuals and organizations referred to as Bitcoin Miners. Bitcoin
            miners process and verify bitcoin transactions through a mathematical algorithm based on the cryptographic
            (hence the name cryptocurrency) hash algorithm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" rel="follow">SHA256</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Bitcoin is Decentralized</h2>

        <p>No central authority controls Bitcoin or its network of transactions. A community of Bitcoin miners make up
            the network, processing the transactions. If any changes are made to Bitcoin by a developer or developers
            using <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" rel="follow">GitHub</a>, a 51% majority of the miners
            hashing power must agree upon it. This insures that, in theory, no individual can steal your bitcoins or
            print (create) more.</p>

        <h2>How Can One Change Bitcoin and Bitcoin's code?</h2>

        <p>Everyone can contribute to and edit the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin" target="_blank"
                                                      rel="follow">Bitcoin source code</a> since the Bitcoin protocol is
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank" rel="follow">open source</a>. The Bitcoin
            protocol is viewable for all making it easier to spot weaknesses and provide suggestions for improvement.
            However, if a developer edit the Bitcoin code, that edit has to be accepted by more than 51% or more of the
            Bitcoin miners that runs the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin can be seen as a democratic currency where the
            majority always decide what will happen next with the Bitcoin source code.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin Wallet and Transactions</h2>

            <p class="wp-caption-text">Is Bitcoin Anonymous?</p></div>
        <p>Though each Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a <a href="https://blockchain.info/" target="_blank"
                                                               rel="follow">public log</a> called the block chain, names
            of buyers and sellers are never revealed – <strong>only their Bitcoin wallet addresses.</strong> Each wallet
            address is unique and can't be linked to anyone unless the creator of that specific bitcoin address reveals
            himself.</p>

        <p><strong>1Lst6Ro8r5C7QrxAuoZg1LJAuQtP3W9uV2 </strong>is an example of a unique bitcoin address used for
            receiving and sending bitcoins.</p>

        <p>To send, receive and create Bitcoin addresses you must have a Bitcoin wallet <em>(Learn how to chose the
            correct Bitcoin wallet <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet" target="_blank"
                                      rel="follow">here</a>)</em>. A Bitcoin wallet is a software that's essentially
            your bank account for bitcoins. Your wallet can hold as many bitcoins and Bitcoin addresses you'd like, and
            you can own as many wallets you want.</p>

        <p>While bitcoin can be anonymous, that doesn't mean it is. If you purchase your bitcoins on a Bitcoin trading
            platform or exchange that has your information, the bitcoins you buy can be tied back to you.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin is Transparent</h2>

        <p>Every Bitcoin transaction that has ever happened is stored in detail in the public ledger known as the block
            chain. By using the block chain, anyone can see how many bitcoins are stored on a particular address, and
            they can see the deposits and withdrawals to that address, but they will be unable to know who owns the
            address.</p>

        <h2><img
                class="alignleft  wp-image-42434"

                alt="bitcoin non reversable" width="190" height="240"/>Bitcoin Transactions Can not be Reversed</h2>

        <p>When you send bitcoins to a Bitcoin address, you can not reverse the transaction. Unlike credit cards where
            transaction can be disputed or reversed, bitcoins are nonrefundable. Bitcoin can not be replaced either. If
            your wallet is stored on your hard drive and not in a “cloud”, you could lose your bitcoins if you are
            hacked, get a virus or if your computer dies. <strong>These lost bitcoins can never be retrieved. That's why
                it is so important to take regular backups and implement measures for <a
                        href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-wallet-security-best-practices/">Bitcoin wallet
                    security</a>.<br/>
            </strong></p>

        <p>Furthermore, merchants cannot initiate charges on you as they can and do with credit cards. Each transaction
            must be initiated by the wallet holder, further underlining the advantages of the Bitcoin system.</p>

                alt="bitcoin is secure" width="251" height="251"/>Bitcoin is Secure</h2>

        <p>Proponents of <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> tout its formidable <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/bitcoin-security/">security</a>, and with good reason. In
            theory, unless <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/4-lines-defence-51-attack/">51% of the system</a> is
            controlled by one party, Bitcoin is virtually unhackable. For instance, in order for someone to change a
            transaction or double spend a Bitcoin, they would have to obtain majority control of the system and modify
            every miner in this majority. <strong>When there is a disagreement in the block chain, the system overrides
                the minority with the data agreed upon by the majority.</strong></p>

        <p>However, there have been <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-mining-pool-ghash-io-is-unapologetic-risk-theoretical-51-attack/">concerns</a>
            that different mining companies and mining pools should be able to reach 51% of the Bitcoin hashing power
            and perform a so called <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/4-lines-defence-51-attack/">51% attack</a>
            on the Bitcoin network.</p>

        <h2><img

                alt="what bitcoin is" width="250" height="250"/>How are Bitcoins Created?</h2>

        <p>Bitcoins are created through a process known as <strong>mining</strong>. Mining is the term used by those who
            contribute to processing transactions. Miners process and secure the network using specialized hardware that
            “mine” for new bitcoins. As “payment” for their contribution, they are awarded new bitcoins. <strong>This is
                how new bitcoins are generated.</strong></p>

        <p>New coins are created at a fixed and decreasing rate that is predictable. The number of coins created each
            year is halved over time until 21 million bitcoins are in circulation. At this point, bitcoin miners will be
            rewarded by transaction fees.</p>

        <p>When a miner has successfully created a new hash, the block is sealed off and added to the block chain. 25
            bitcoins are awarded to the miner who discovered the new hash. The number of bitcoins rewarded per block is
            cut in half every four years. Blocks are solved an approximate rate of 6 per hour.</p>

        <h2>Why use Bitcoins?</h2>

        <p>Bitcoins are attractive to a large number of people of an equally large number of reasons. Bitcoins can be
            anonymous, near instantaneous and offer a level of control over your money like no other traditional
            currency. There are no banks that can take away your money, and Bitcoins are deflationary in nature, while
            e.g. USD is inflationary where your money depreciate over time. Bitcoins are also speculative in nature
            drawing the attention of investors.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/accepts-bitcoin">Merchants</a> are drawn to Bitcoin because
            of the low fees. Merchants typically pay 2-3% fees from credit card processors, whereas many types of
            transactions are free with Bitcoin. Transactions are free if several conditions are met. Any transactions
            that don't meet thee requirements are charged 0.1mBTC (0.0001 BTC) per 1,000 bytes. Typical transactions are
            500 bytes but do not meet the priority requirement and thus are charged a 0.1mBTC fee regardless how many
            coins are transferred. You can view the live Bitcoin price <a

        <h2>How to Obtain Bitcoins</h2>

        <p>There are several ways to obtain bitcoins. The most common way is to purchase them on a <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-exchanges">Bitcoin exchange</a>. You can also purchase
            bitcoins on Ebay locally through e.g. <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/" target="_blank" rel="follow">LocalBitcoins.com</a>.

        <p>Bitcoins can also be obtained by becoming a part of the Bitcoin network and start mining for bitcoins. Before
            the days of <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/purchase-asic-scrypt-miner/">ASIC miners</a>,
            individuals could set up their computers to mine and earn bitcoins easily. Those days are long gone due to
            the difficulty to mine Bitcoin, the difficulty level of Bitcoin, has risen enormous making it harder and
            harder to earn bitcoins with the same equipment. Becoming a miner and seeing positive ROI would mean a
            substantial investment and is now left to the big companies and wealthy investors. For most individuals,
            purchasing your Bitcoin through a <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/bitcoin-exchanges">Bitcoin
                Exchange</a> is the best option. You can also find ways to<strong> earn free bitcoins</strong>.</p>
