        <p><b>Even if they do not accurately understand how it works, most people are at least somewhat familiar with <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. However, once they begin to get
            involved with cryptocurrency, they may be surprised to learn that there are actually hundreds of types of
            cryptocurrencies known as altcoins. Altcoins are an intriguing facet of the cryptocurrency landscape, but
            they are not for everyone. Altcoin newcomers often have many questions, and this guide will provide a brief
            overview of altcoins to help beginners decide whether or not to invest in them as part of their
            cryptocurrency portfolio.</b></p>

        <h2>What Are Altcoins and Why Do They Matter?</h2>

        <p>The word “<a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/alt-coin-news">altcoin</a>” is an abbreviation of “Bitcoin
            alternative,” and thus describes every single cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin. Altcoins are referred to as
            Bitcoin alternatives because, at least to some extent, most altcoins hope to either replace or improve upon
            at least one Bitcoin component.</p>

        <p>There are hundreds of altcoins (<a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/views/all/">CoinMarketCap</a>
            listed 478 at the time this guide was written), and more appear each day. Most altcoins are little more than
            Bitcoin clones, changing only minor characteristics such as its transactions speed, distribution method, or
            hashing algorithm. Most of these coins do not survive for very long. One exception is <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/litecoin-news/">Litecoin</a>, which was one of the
            first altcoins. In addition to using a different hashing algorithm than Bitcoin, Litecoin has a much higher
            number of currency units. For this reason, Litecoin has branded itself as "silver to Bitcoin's gold."</p>

        <p>However, some altcoins innovate by experimenting with useful features Bitcoin does not offer. For example, <a
                href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/darkcoin-news/">Darkcoin</a> hopes to provide a platform
            for completely anonymous transactions, <a

                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitshares-exclusive-interview-decentralized-autonomous-companies/">BitShares</a>
            describes itself as "a fair version of Wall Street," and <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/ripple">Ripple</a> serves as a protocol users can employ
            to make inter-currency payments with ease. Some altcoin ecosystems, such as <a

                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/counterparty-first-bitcoin-2-0-platform-offer-armory-offline-wallet-support/">CounterParty</a>
            and <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/tag/mastercoin/">Mastercoin</a>, even utilize the <a
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin blockchain</a> to secure their
            platform.</p>

        <p><strong>Many Bitcoin enthusiasts argue that altcoins are completely unnecessary and will not succeed because
            they cannot rival the infrastructure Bitcoin boasts. However, altcoins serve an important role.
            Decentralization is one of Bitcoin's most prominent goals, and altcoins further decentralize the
            cryptocurrency community. Moreover, altcoins allow developers to experiment with unique features. While it
            is true that Bitcoin can copy these features if the developers or community desires, fully-functioning
            altcoins are much better "cryptocurrency laboratories" than Bitcoin's testnet. Finally, Altcoins give
            Bitcoin healthy competition. Altcoins give cryptocurrency users alternative options and forces Bitcoin's
            developers to remain active and continue innovating. If users do not feel that Bitcoin satisfies their
            digital desires, they can adopt an altcoin. If enough users left Bitcoin for a particular altcoin, the
            Bitcoin developers would have to adopt the features the community desired or risk losing its place as the
            preeminent cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

                identities.</p></div>
        <h2>What Was the First Altcoin?</h2>

        <p>Created in April 2011, <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/turkeys-twitter-ban-push-citizens-namecoin/">Namecoin</a>
            was the first altcoin. Although it also functions as a currency, Namecoin’s primary purpose is to
            decentralize domain-name registration, which makes internet censorship much more difficult. As its place
            among the top ten cryptocurrency market caps suggests, Namecoin has remained one of the most successful
            altcoins throughout its short lifespan.</p>

        <h2>Should I Invest in Altcoins?</h2>

        <p><strong>Due to how recent cryptocurrency was invented and how rapidly the landscape changes, all
            cryptocurrency investments carry a great deal of risk. Even Bitcoin--by far the most stable
            cryptocurrency--exhibits price volatility on a regular basis.</strong></p>

        <p>By comparison, however, altcoins are exponentially more volatile. Because they have such low market caps (the
            total value of all coins combined), altcoin markets are highly prone to price manipulation. Wealthy
            traders--colloquially called "whales"--often inject large amounts of capital into low-priced coins to build
            hype and cause the price to skyrocket. Once the price has risen considerably, the whales sell their coins on
            exchanges at a massive profit, hurting many gullible investors in the process. This method is known as a "<a
                    title="Pump and Dump: Know the Signs when Trading Altcoins"
                    href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/pump-dump-know-signs-trading-altcoins/">pump and dump</a>."
            Not only does this hurt greedy traders who did not take the time to do their homework, but it often proves
            to be the breath of an altcoin's brief lifespan.</p>

        <p>To avoid losing all your money in a pump and dump, focus on long-term investments in coins you believe have
            immense potential and exhibit overall health. Generally, healthy altcoins possess strong communities,
            exhibit high liquidity, and have developers who proactively improve the coin’s source code (though not
            necessary, many users also prefer developers who reveal their true identities). <a

            statistically analyzes these three important factors and ranks coins according to overall strength.</p>

        <p>If you do choose to invest in altcoins, it is important to remember some basic tenets of investing. Avoid the
            hype that coin communities propagate. Investors have an agenda, so you should not take their word at face
            value. Only invest in coins you have researched. It is unwise to invest in something you do not understand.
            Making an ill-informed investment is the first step to losing your hard-earned money. Take the time to
            research the coins you are considering for long-term investments, and research day-trading before you
            attempt to become a high-volume, short-term trader. Most importantly, never invest more than you can afford
            to lose. Far too many people have lost their life savings by centralizing them in volatile investments.</p>

        <h2>Where Can I Obtain Altcoins?</h2>

        <p>As with Bitcoin, there are a variety of ways to obtain altcoins. The most basic way to obtain altcoins is to
            accept them as payment for goods or services. If you are interested in doing this, place an ad showcasing
            your skill-set on a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs4crypto">cryptocurrency job board</a>.</p>

        <p>You can also trade for altcoins on <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/category/bitcoin-exchanges/">cryptocurrency
            exchanges</a>. Most exchange use Bitcoin as an intermediary (although a few include fiat pairs), so if you
            do not already own bitcoins you will need to buy some before you can trade for altcoins. Some of the
            most-trafficked exchanges include <a href="https://bter.com/">BTER</a>, <a
                    href="http://bittrex.com">Bittrex</a>, <a href="http://mintpal.com">MintPal</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.cryptsy.com">Cryptsy</a>, and <a href="http://www.btc38.com/">BTC38</a>
            (Chinese-only).</p>

        <p>Many altcoin communities also sponsor giveaways to increase exposure of their coin and entice new users to
            join their communities. This is a great way to acquire coins if you are low on funds or do not have
            marketable skills.</p>
