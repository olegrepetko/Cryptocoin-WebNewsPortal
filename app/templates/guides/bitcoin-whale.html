                width="411" height="231"/>The term <em>"whale"</em> is frequently used to describe the big money
            Bitcoin players that show their hand in the Bitcoin market. The ocean as a metaphor for the market is apt,
            since one can then extend it to include the big fish and the small fish; sharks; rallies as feeding
            frenzies; waves as market moves; and so forth. It may be, however, that the term <em>"whale"</em> has been
            applied to the wrong class of investor because the players described below are truly the biggest creatures
            in the ocean.</p>

        <p>They show themselves in the exchanges with orders of 1000 BTC, every now and again, and the common perception
            seems to be that the orderbook <em>"whales"</em> are the heavyweight players who move the market and can
            manipulate price if they so desire. However, this view is inaccurate.</p>

        <p>The fact is that there are even bigger players than the so-called <em>whales</em>, who do not engage in the
            Bitcoin market via the dinky web interfaces the exchanges offer us, the "retail market" (small fish).</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin Whales</h2>

            The large players being referred to are institutions such as Hedge Funds
            and Bitcoin Investment Funds. Some of these funds have announced their presence in the water:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/frontier-pantera-investment-fund-focus-virtual-currencies/2014/03/20">Pantera

            <li>Bitcoins Reserve</li>
            <li>Binary Financial</li>
            <li>Coin Capital Partners</li>
            <li>Falcon Global Capital</li>
            <li>Fortress</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.bitcointrust.co/" target="_blank">Bitcoin Investment Trust</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/jersey-become-worlds-first-bitcoin-isle/2014/07/11">Global
                Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Others have yet to put oar to water...</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/sec-receptive-to-winklevoss-bitcoin-trust/2014/01/18">Bitcoin
                Index Fund</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>... and others may or may not exist, depending on your sources and the reach of your sonar.</p>

        <p>These funds typically manage <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of bitcoins, which they strategically and
            covertly put through the exchanges via special arrangement - out of sight and obscured from regular retail
            traders.</p>

        <p>With their large capital mass, institutions can move the market at will. It is here where the metaphor of a
            <em>Bitcoin Whale</em> comes into its own because any other inhabitant of the ocean must simply get out of
            the way, or be moved forcefully. Additionally, no current is strong enough to deflect the <em>whale</em>
            from its course, so its intention becomes the way.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin Liquidity</h2>

        <p>By injecting, say, 50,000 BTC, over the course of a week, a massive price change can be effected. Yet, doing
            so, for its own sake is pointless because the institution's objective, just like smaller players, is to buy
            low and sell high - in other words, to turn a profit after each investment.</p>

        <p>Here is an interaction with the Bitstamp API via IRC channel #bitcoin-otc:</p>
<pre>[14:01]  | ;;market buy 50000
[14:01]  | Bitstamp | This order would exceed the size of the order book. You would buy 19,434.758
                      bitcoins, for a total of 19,191,083.3531 USD and take the price to 99,999.9900.</pre>
        <p>Buying 1 BTC now and selling a split-second later results in a trading loss due to the spread between the buy
            and sell prices. Let's increase the amount of BTC in this example: buying, say, 10,000 BTC all in one go,
            and assuming the exchange could absorb that amount, would not only move the market price, it would also
            trigger ask orders on the way up, as well as see many participants take profit at higher levels.</p>
<pre>[14:07]  | ;;market buy 10000
[14:07]  | Bitstamp | A market order to buy 10,000 bitcoins right now would take 6,213,164.9471 USD
                      and would take the last price up to 660.8200 USD, resulting in an average price
                      of 621.3165 USD/BTC.</pre>
        <p>Hence, large market transactions are appropriate for exiting trades, but not for initiating them, since the
            effect of spread and of triggering "obstacle" limit orders reduces the net effect of large orders in the
            market. Instead, the largest players have to stagger and obscure their market entries by splitting large
            trades into hundreds or thousands of small orders and then drip these into the market over hours, days or
            weeks.</p>

        <h2>This Way, Please</h2>

        <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-30562"
                src="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Moby_Dick_final_chase-187x300.jpg"
                alt="Bitcoin Institutional Players Whales" width="187" height="300"/>Given the institution's desire to
            maximize the profitability of a large trade it initiates, it would increase the distance that this trade
            travels if the institution can have retailers (the small fish) join them in the move. Hence, the largest
            players have no choice, but to "prime" the market: to read wider market conditions, assess the retail
            sector's "mood" and the willingness of market participants to go in a particular direction.</p>

        <p>Once an opportunity is identified, the task is then to "massage" the market and steer participants in the
            desired direction. The institutional player, therefore, achieves a greater return on investment - the
            investment having been the expenditure of setting up and "massaging" a particular move - and the outcome of
            the move being that small retailers and new public participants had taken the bait and herded into the
            rally, thereby increasing its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_impact" target="_blank">market
                impact</a> and <a
                    href="http://stocks.about.com/od/gettingstarted/a/041711-How-To-Legally-Manipulate-Stock-Prices.htm"
                    target="_blank">slingshot</a> effect.</p>

        <h2>Market-wide phenomenon</h2>

        <p>If any reader thinks that this sounds incredible, be assured that this is not my proposal of how I think it
            works, it's standard <a href="http://idei.fr/doc/wp/2011/manipulation.pdf" target="_blank">hedge fund
                practice</a>. Large banks, the market makers for most of the Forex market, have teams of traders
            dedicated to doing <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-10-04/insider-exposes-algo-secrets-fx-market"
                                  target="_blank">just this</a> via trade plans that last anywhere from a day to a few
            weeks.</p>

        <p>The Bitcoin market has several characteristics that make it ideal for high risk institutional investors like
            hedge funds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Small market capitalization</li>
            <li>Relatively naive participants</li>
            <li>No bank competitors</li>
            <li>No regulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The institutions listed at the top of the article have apparently become active in the Bitcoin market during
            the course of the past two years. While there is no sense in speaking of <a
                    href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303299604577326031119412436"
                    target="_blank">collusion</a>, it seems only rational that large players should (at least,
            sometimes) coordinate their actions. Given that there are community members who are known to hold sizable
            amounts of Bitcoin, one could imagine that they would reasonably discuss and align their interests with
            other potential market movers.</p>

        <p>So, it's not about that 1000 BTC order you see in the exchange orderbook, or the 50 BTC that went through
            Dell's online retail store today. The BTC market, although high-risk and based on an innovation that's
            difficult to fathom, is a speculator's wildest dream come true. All the time while it is adjusting
            downwards, it's because the largest players are herding the bait-ball.</p>

        <p>As for the small Bitcoin fish it's most beneficial to just swim <em>with the Bitcoin whale</em> and swim away
            when the mood starts getting frenzied near the surface. Knowing <em>what time it is</em>, is the challenge.
